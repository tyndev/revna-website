  <section class="problem">

      <h2>The back end is always the scramble.</h2>
      <p class="section-subhead">Testing goes fine. Then the reporting starts.</p>

          <h3>Scattered data</h3>
          <p>Test forms in one folder, journals in another, photos on someone's phone. You spend hours hunting before you even start writing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem-card reveal">

          <h3>Cell-by-cell checks</h3>
          <p>Manual cross-referencing between test sheets, specs, and settings lists. One missed value means a client rejection.</p>

          <p class="card-label">03 — Compiling &amp; Rework</p>
          <h3>Assembly line restarts</h3>
          <p>Copy-paste into report templates. Client requests a change — and you're rebuilding sections from scratch.</p>
        </div>
