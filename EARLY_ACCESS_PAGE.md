# Early Access Page — Layout Scratchpad

> Iterate on structure/copy here before building the HTML.

## Nav Changes
- Rename "Contact" → "Early Access" (link to `early-access.html`)
- Reorder: `Early Access | FAQ`
- Update both header nav and footer links
- Hero CTA "Book a Demo" → decide if we keep or replace with early access CTA

---

## Page Goal
Visitor lands here interested in Revna → understands the early access offer fast → joins the waitlist.

## Target Audience
Electrical T&C team leads / owners who've seen the homepage and want in.

## Page Layout

### 1. Hero
**Headline:** Join the Revna Early Access Program
**Subhead:** Be one of the first teams to test the workflow in a real environment — and shape the product through your feedback.
**CTA:** Join the Waitlist (scrolls to form or opens inline)

### 2. What You Get (3-4 cards or list)
- **Real-world testing** — Use Revna on actual projects for 3 months starting May 1
- **Dedicated onboarding & support** — High-touch setup, direct line to the team
- **Shape the product** — Your feedback drives what gets built next
- **Fee credited toward full subscription** — Early access fee applies 100% to your first paid term

### 3. How It Works (timeline or steps)
1. **Join the waitlist** — Sign up with your info
2. **We'll reach out** — Scoping conversation to confirm fit
3. **Onboarding (May 1)** — We get you set up on real projects
4. **3 months of testing + feedback** — First 60 days active feedback, final 30 days transition
5. **Seamless transition** — Keep using Revna at general availability

### 4. Pricing
- Early access starts around **$5,000** depending on scope
- 100% of that fee is **credited toward your first full payment**
- Full product pricing shared transparently before you commit

### 5. FAQ (inline, 3-4 questions)
- **How far along is the product?** — Actively building our beta version. Opening early access to a limited number of partners now.
- **What if it doesn't work out?** — Export all your data to CSV. You keep everything.
- **What about security / SOC 2?** — Not at early access stage. Customer data secured via [TODO: 3 specific measures].
- **What does "limited" mean?** — We're keeping the group small so every partner gets dedicated attention.

### 6. Waitlist Form
- Name
- Company
- Email
- Role (optional)
- Team size (optional, dropdown: 1-5, 6-15, 16-50, 50+)
- CTA button: "Request Early Access"

### 7. Footer Note
"Questions? Reach out at [email]" — keeps a contact path without a separate Contact page.

## Open Questions
- Waitlist backend? (Formspree? Tally? Google Forms embed? Custom?)
- Keep "Book a Demo" CTA on homepage or replace with early access CTA?
- Do we want a "limited spots" urgency element or keep it understated?
- Should the hero CTA on index.html also point to early access now?
- Security answer — what are the 3 specific measures? (TODO from Feb 22)
