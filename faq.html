          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Offline is a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have. Revna runs as a desktop app with a local database on each laptop. Your team can enter test data, run calculations, view plots, and attach files with zero internet. When connectivity returns, everything syncs automatically. If it can't sync, the app tells you — it never silently drops data.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>If it runs Windows, yes. Revna is a desktop application that works on Windows laptops, Surface-style tablets, and ruggedized Toughbooks — the same hardware your team already uses in the field. No mobile app needed for the core workflow.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We know field teams snap nameplate photos on their phones — that's not going away. Revna supports importing photos from cloud-synced folders like OneDrive camera roll. Your phone syncs the photo, Revna picks it up on the laptop. No manual file shuffling.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Rare in practice — different team members usually work on different equipment. But when it happens, Revna detects the conflict, shows both values with who entered what and when, and lets a lead pick the right one. No silent overwrites.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>For the projects you run through Revna, yes. We've thought hard about this. Trying to keep two systems in sync — someone updating an Excel form on OneDrive while a lead works from Revna — leads to conflicting data and eroded trust. Revna needs to be your single source of truth for the projects you use it on. But you don't have to switch everything overnight. Start with one project, validate it works, then expand.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Upload your existing Excel test form templates or export your PowerDB database, and Revna extracts the field definitions, calculations, and structure. You review the extraction, toggle fields on or off, and adjust as needed. The goal is that your team sees their familiar form layout on day one — not a generic template that doesn't match how they work.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Completed forms get imported with their data, incomplete ones just need the template. You don't have to wait for a fresh project to try Revna.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The biggest time investment is the initial template migration — getting your forms into the system. Once that's done, the day-to-day interface is designed to feel familiar to anyone who's filled out test forms in Excel. We're building onboarding to be hands-on: we'll work directly with your team during the pilot to make the transition smooth.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. Every T&C firm has different client requirements, and we're designing for that from day one. You'll be able to control what sections are included or excluded, toggle fields per-report or per-project, choose between a single PDF package or organized zip folders, and adjust formatting without touching test data. Admins can set company-wide defaults, and leads can override per-project or per-client.</p>

            <p>Data is stored locally on your devices with optional encryption at rest. When it syncs, it travels over encrypted connections to our servers. Every edit is stamped with who changed what and when, giving you a full audit trail. We know T&C firms handle sensitive client infrastructure data and we're building security in from the start, not bolting it on later.</p>

            <p>We're in the design and architecture phase right now. The product decisions — offline-first, desktop app, local database, automated report assembly — are locked in. What we're doing now is talking to T&C teams to make sure we build the right thing before we build it. We're looking for a small number of pilot partners to work with closely as we develop.

            <p>We'd work directly with your team on a real project. You share your existing forms and workflows, we migrate your templates into Revna, and your team uses it alongside us so we can iterate fast. Pilot partners get direct input on features and priority access as the product develops. We're not looking for hundreds of users — we're looking for a few teams who feel this pain deeply enough to help us get it right.</p>
