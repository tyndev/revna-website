        <h1>Built by someone who's been in the yard.</h1>
        <p class="subhead">Rook didn't start in a product lab. It started at the tail end of a commissioning project — buried in test forms, cross-referencing relay settings at midnight, wondering why the reporting was always the hardest part.</p>

  <!-- The Problem We Saw -->
  <section class="about-section alt-bg">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="reveal">The problem we saw</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Commissioning teams are technically excellent. They configure relays, validate protection schemes, and energize substations — work that demands precision and deep expertise.</p>
      <p class="reveal">Then the project wraps, and they spend <span class="highlight">weeks assembling final reports</span>. Test forms scattered across folders. Photos on three different phones. Client specs that change mid-compilation. The report queue backs up, invoicing stalls, and the next project starts before the last one closes out.</p>
      <p class="reveal"><span class="highlight">The paperwork shouldn't be the bottleneck.</span> But for most teams, it is.</p>

  <!-- What We're Building -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="reveal">What we're building</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Rook is reporting software purpose-built for electrical testing and commissioning. It takes the raw outputs of your fieldwork — test forms, protection journals, relay settings, photos — and compiles them into client-ready deliverable packages.</p>
      <p class="reveal">No more copy-paste. No more hunting for files. No more rebuilding sections when a client requests a change.</p>
      <p class="reveal"><span class="highlight">We're talking to commissioning teams right now to build this right.</span> Not guessing at features — listening to the people who live this problem every day.</p>

      <h2>We're looking for commissioning teams to shape this product.</h2>
